//! Two-way sync of mapped remote folders with local folders, shared by the desktop and mobile
//! clients. What differs between them is behind [`Platform`].
//!
//! Every pass compares three states per path: the remote tree (kept current from the
//! server's change journal), a scan of the local folders and the bases recorded when both
//! last agreed (see [`plan`]). Passes run on start, after local file changes, after server
//! events and every few minutes.
//!
//! A path that fails is tried again later, waiting longer after each failure. When the
//! server cannot be reached at all, such as behind a gateway answering 502, the failures
//! are not the paths' fault: after a few in a row the pass stops starting transfers and the
//! sync reports one [`Outage`], trying again with a growing delay.
//!
//! A chunked upload's session is saved in the [`store`], so that after a restart it
//! continues from what the server already has, as long as the file is unchanged. Sessions of
//! files changed, deleted or no longer to be uploaded are cancelled on the server.

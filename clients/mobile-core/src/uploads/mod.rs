//! Files the user picks to upload. They wait in a queue kept on disk and go up one at a time, so
//! they carry on when the app next runs, whatever ended this run. Each goes up from a copy of its

//!
//! The queue runs on the Rust runtime, not in a caller's coroutine: a screen going away doesn't stop
//! it. See `docs/specs/mobile-files.feature`.

//! Auto-upload: local folders the user marks go up to a folder on the server. New and changed files
//! are sent. Nothing on the server ever changes the local folder.
//!
//! The apps own what Rust can't reach: a folder on Android is a `content://` tree and a photo on
//! iOS is a PhotoKit asset, neither of them with a path. So they list and read files through
//! [`LocalSources`], decide when a pass runs and whether the network allows it, and pass the
//! outcome to the user. See `docs/specs/mobile-sync.feature`.
